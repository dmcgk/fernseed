There’s always a chance&mldr; but in all honesty, you’ll die.”</p><p>“I am a scholar of the fort.”</p><p>“Melodrama?”</p><p>“Self-realisation.”</p><p>“Melodrama.”</p><p>They walked another loop through the wide, shallow bowl near the overlap with normalcy, through the little spikes of ice-in-the-nethers clarity brought on by the inversion of it all: the once slow-rise into the hill-that-was, now a scarred, shallow indentation. Flaps of excess skin sewn up after excising the cyst. It seemed exactly as overgrown, exactly as furrowed and ploughed-through as on the day of the event, the day of the <em>absence</em> of event.</p><p>“Typical Wednesday.”</p><p>Their refrain. <em>I did not see this coming</em>.</p><p>“Typical Wednesday,” she confirmed. Wednesday 22nd July, eighteen-months-and-change ago. <em>Today</em> she would meet with the anchoress. The third attempt overall, this one long past due.</p><p>“It doesn&rsquo;t have to be <em>you</em>.”</p><p>“No. And yet,” she gestured at the absence of volunteers.</p><hr><p>They had been two of the first to arrive, a bond that lingered. Two of only a half dozen to have lived within close visual range of the hill before its abrupt <em>absence</em>. They had shared the same mix of incredulity and embarrassment of self-doubt. There were no startled cries, no pontifications. They began instead with:</p><p><em>This cannot have been a singular phenomenon of nature.</em></p><p>Not solely. Around the central shaft downwards—towards one of ten successive, partially-fortified platforms—they had discovered the first set of apparently abandoned apparatus: torches, lamps, simple rigging. No excavation tools. Nothing exotic. It wasn’t clean enough for some spontaneous outburst of new physics, yet too strangely and quickly done for a manned event.</p><p><em>It has the appearance of antiquity</em>.</p><p>Each level showed obvious degradation, whether under layers of mosses or the thick accretion of dust.</p><p><em>The revealed structure may be unrelated to the disappearance.</em></p><p>Perhaps there had always been an entrance down into whatever-this-was, the hill always some temporary capstone, no matter how many generations had known and walked it.</p><p><em>Can this really have occurred.</em></p><p>Was there any possibility that they were, if not collectively insane, then simply <em>mistaken</em>? Caught up in some narrow-beam psychological confusion, a hyper-local <em>Mandela Effect</em>? It was wildly easy to doubt what had been cast-iron certainty when all evidence of the certainty was removed. None of them had anything as trivialising as a photograph. Not even showing as a background feature in an unrelated shot. On their phones, satellite images showed only a low resolution static of trees, too far from any mapping-friendly roads for a side-elevation view.</p><hr><p>The platforms were a series of sections through stone, as though a mountainside had been cut away <em>downwards</em> to show uncannily uniform strata, each layer apparently self-contained, each at slightly different angles, depths and prominences out into a central funnel of clear space, wider as they descended. Each seemed snapped or broken off, but not artificially so, without any obvious marks of tooling.</p><p>The whole edifice had the feel of a <em>nook</em>, of a place set-aside. It had the sense and shape of a shelter. As though a weak seam in the world had been forced open and co-opted as a hiding place.</p><p>“Somewhere to sit out the end of all things.”</p><p>“And yet you choose not to.”</p><p>The bottom. Wide and flat and damp. Clearly concrete underfoot. They turned towards her rooms, towards the woman who claimed to have been living there for notional-years before any of them had arrived that first day. The woman who claimed the underfort had always been exposed to sky.</p><p class=tagline><a href=/projects/fragments><em>Fragments</em></a></p><p class=tagline><a href=/fiction class=p-category>#Fiction</a>
