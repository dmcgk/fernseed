      <description>&lt;![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a few different people recently re-start personal blogs and it made me want to tinker with static site tools again&hellip; I&rsquo;ve also been wondering how many little painting projects I&rsquo;ve started and just left half-done here on Mastodon (11. The answer is currently <em>11</em>).</p>
<p>So&hellip; still very much a WIP (another, add it to the count), but technically this works, syncing up Mastodon toots and stats as purely static content:</p>]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[<p>‚Äú[&hellip;] your appointed festivals I hate with all my being. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; [‚Ä¶] Your hands are full of blood! [‚Ä¶] Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong.</p>
<p>Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.‚Äù</p>]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[<p>It has been <em>weeks</em> since I did any actual painting. I&rsquo;m really not sure this effect on the pointy bit‚Äôs working, or even in keeping with the rest of the model, but it <em>is</em> ultimately more acrylic-on-plastic so I&rsquo;m calling it a win!</p>]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[<p>I‚Äôve binged so much of Adam from North of the Border‚Äôs YouTube over the last week that I somehow find myself in the possession of both a pack of Super Sculpey and a spool of armature wire.</p>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[<p>Finally thoroughly cleaning and reorganising my hobby desk. It&rsquo;s unclear to me how I&rsquo;ve come to own quite so many paintbrushes. At least 1.5 per month back in the hobby. Do they slowly accrete from airbrush overspray?</p>]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[<p>Didn‚Äôt progress past round one in the NYC Midnight short story competition, but the judges‚Äô feedback is so good that I‚Äôm considering redrafting it and actually submitting somewhere. It‚Äôs been a long while since I had enough enthusiasm for a story to try a second take.</p>]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[<p>I always intended to go back to this one and do a finishing pass or two before submitting to the competition on MMF, but the thought of doing so put me off <em>any hobbying at all</em> for several days üòÖ. So I‚Äôm calling this guy done. This will be the hero shot. Also the first mini photo I‚Äôve ever removed the ‚ÄòWIP‚Äô tag from.</p>]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[<p>Head, shoulder, knee and toes (knee and toes). It may be a royal pain trying to colour-match freehand mistakes on a stippled shoulder gradient, but here we are. It‚Äôs all just a mix of the same two paints. How bad could it get üò¨</p>]]></description>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[<p>Random midweek experiments: I wondered if I&rsquo;d be able to get a smooth blend from quite dark to quite bright going brown-to-ivories, without resorting to an airbrush. I think the answer is definitely &rsquo;no&rsquo;, at least with this approach. It gives its own effect though, the scratchiness of it could probably be read as weathering? I&rsquo;ll have to give stippling a try.</p>]]></description>
