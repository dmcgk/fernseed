It definitely leaves some unintentional texture at the boundaries but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs an Ork. It‚Äôs 90% unintentional texture. As long as the face detail isn‚Äôt obscured it‚Äôll probably be grand.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:44:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>9:41 am, August 17, 2025</title><link>https://fernseed.org/2025-08-17-09-41/</link><description>&lt;p>Well, chalk that one up to experience. I‚Äôd finally picked up the paints again after months only to ‚Äòruin‚Äô (slightly mar, to the point of minor but strongly-held annoyance) a mini while experimenting with masking fluid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It‚Äôs barely visible in the image but there are small patches where it‚Äôs either inaccessible to get at and peel, or where it‚Äôs adhered in a crevice and stuck. I don‚Äôt want overpaint or I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll flake off at an inconvenient time later.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:41:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>6:08 pm, August 13, 2025</title><link>https://fernseed.org/2025-08-13-18-08/</link><description>&lt;p>Alien: Earth is the most interesting thing they&amp;rsquo;ve done with the franchise in literal decades.

&lt;p>Exercising on a rowing machine at lunch today I was surprised and delighted when the instructor randomly started talking about Commerce Bots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ohh, thinks I, little robot buddies out bartering on the river!?&lt;/p>

This was a bit of fun to potter about with on a sunny Saturday in the garden&amp;ndash;pulling my image posts from Mastodon into a single small gallery and badging them according to how they were tagged. No JS required, all static.&lt;/p>

The answer is currently &lt;em>11&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; still very much a WIP (another, add it to the count), but technically this works, syncing up Mastodon toots and stats as purely static content:&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 17:02:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>11:19 am, April 25, 2025</title><link>https://fernseed.org/2025-04-25-11-19/</link><description>&lt;p>It will be incredibly interesting, when all episodes are available, to rewatch and recontextualise Andor ‚Üí Rogue One ‚Üí OT as ‚ÄòThe Mon Mothma Saga‚Äô.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 11:19:00 +0100</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
