This was a bit of fun to potter about with on a sunny Saturday in the garden&amp;ndash;pulling my image posts from Mastodon into a single small gallery and badging them according to how they were tagged. No JS required, all static.&lt;/p>

The answer is currently &lt;em>11&lt;/em>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So&amp;hellip; still very much a WIP (another, add it to the count), but technically this works, syncing up Mastodon toots and stats as purely static content:&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 17:02:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>11:19 am, April 25, 2025</title><link>https://fernseed.org/2025-04-25-11-19/</link><description>&lt;p>It will be incredibly interesting, when all episodes are available, to rewatch and recontextualise Andor ‚Üí Rogue One ‚Üí OT as ‚ÄòThe Mon Mothma Saga‚Äô.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 11:19:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>5:14 pm, April 24, 2025</title><link>https://fernseed.org/2025-04-24-17-14/</link><description>&lt;p>Frantically googling ‚Äòthe song from that bit in andor you know the one‚Äô.&lt;/p></description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 17:14:00 +0100</pubDate></item><item><title>5:17 pm, April 22, 2025</title><link>https://fernseed.org/2025-04-22-17-17/</link><description>&lt;p>A little bit of a clean-up on the blade, and a first attempt at the dreaded eye lenses.
