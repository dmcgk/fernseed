You moved your head compulsively forward and back and from side-to-side, if those could even be called distinct states. Rather you turned your head continuously in great circles bounded by those points, at speed, while you revolved your eyes&mdash;small orbits within the larger&mdash;trying to take in as much of the room as you were able. You have no particular recollection of what you saw; it seems unlikely that you could have perceived anything at all in such a condition, save only the vaguest impression, something based entirely on motion or the lack of it. Your next actual memory is of a growing nausea, though not to eruption, at a point some dozens of seconds later: you have no real sense of the time involved, this scale is pointless. As you retched and keened, dry of eye and throat, with stone dread in your gut, you recognised that this was not at all the optimum manner in which to have approached the situation. Despite anything which may have happened previously, there was almost certainly now no rational way to escape the upcoming scenario, whatever it may be, without your taking harm or fit retribution. You hoped for some unforeknowable incongruity to jut itself across the situation, for an insight, random and complete, on this man&rsquo;s behalf to save you. You hoped that he was both smarter and more merciful, wiser and sadder than yourself; you hoped that he would spare you and help you and heal you, perhaps even be a mentor to you in this place and so grow in his love of you and yours of him until, call it paternally, you parted, some time far in the future, melancholy but enlightened, better prepared for the things which you would find yourself having to face, whatever they might be.</p><p>Time, such as it was, continued to pass in snatches as you embellished this fantasy, until you fell furiously and strenuously unconscious.</p><figure class=featured-image></figure><p class=tagline><a href=/projects/the-second-room><em>The Second Room</em></a></p><p class=tagline><a href=/fiction class=p-category>#Fiction</a></p><p class=tagline><a href=/a-man-is-lost/ class=p-name>A man is lost </a>&#183;
